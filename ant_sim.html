  <h3>Anthill Representations of Peer-to-peer Networks</h3>
</center>
<hr />

<body class="ma3">
  <h5>Introduction to Peer to Peer Networks</h5>
  <p>
    Many of the websites and services we use on a day to day basis are housed
    and run on centralized servers. While centralized servers have their
    beneifits, by virtue of being centralized they come with comprimises. A
    centralized server means governments or individuals looking to intercept
    certain traffic or shut down a service have a single target.
  </p>

  <p>
    An anternative is the Peer-to-peer (P2P) network. In a P2P network users
    talk directly to each other rather than through a centralized server.

      more in depth comparisons of Peer-to-peer and centralized networks as well

  <h5>A Problem With Peer-to-peer Networks</h5>
  <p>
    Figuring out where to get the data you want, such as a video, file, or
    website within a P2P network can be difficult as there isn't necessarily a
    centralized system keeping track of what urls lead where. There are many
    ways of searching for the desired data including many “deterministic”
    approaches such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent"
      >the well known BitTorrent protocol</a
    >. However S. Apel and E. Buchmann claim these approaches “leave aside that:
    peers want to obtain queries at different rates, some keys are more popular
    than others, and peers can be less reliable” (section 4).</p> 
  <p>To solve this problem S. Apel and E. Buchmann as well as others took inspiration from ants. Ants have to
    deal with similar problems when searching for food. The food could be
    anywhere and some food sources are better than others. To solve this problem
    ants leave pheromones in their path. Future ants can then simply follow the
    smelliest path to go where the most of their fellow ants have gone. This
    allows them to quickly organize and accomplish complicated tasks
    collaboratively without requiring a queen to control them all.
  </p>

  <p>
    To explore this idea I decided to create a program that simulated an Anthill
    inspired P2P network
  </p>
  <center>
      <h4>Implementing an Anthill Inspired P2P Network</h4>
  </center>
  <p>
    The ants pheromone system can be implemented in a P2P network in various
    albeit similar ways, however I decided to use the approach taken by A.
    Montresor and O. Babaoglu in the aptly named Anthill framework for the overall design, with some implementation details taken from the excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A">Sebastian Lague</a> Video on simulating ants and slime molds.
  </p>
    In this framework each "peer" or participant in the network is thought of as an Anthill with various ants
    representing the tasks the anthill is capable of such as retrieving a website.
    When these ants are called upon to carry out actions, they leave information
    related to their current task at each anthill they visit. This data left
    behind is the pheromones that can guide future ants trying to accomplish the
    same task. Ideally, through this system efficient pathways to popular sites, files,
    etc are formed so they are easier and take less time to find.<p>
  </p>
  <p>The simulation I created goes through the following steps</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Create a "map" with circles of various colors to represent each nest</li>
      <br>
      <center><img src="./site-assets/map-no-ants.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%" /></center>
      <br>
      <li>Begin iterating through the following steps
          <br><br>
          <ol>
              <li>For each nest randomly decide whether to make a "request". <br>This represents getting a website, downloading a file, sending a chat message etc.</li>
          <br>
              <li>If the nest is making a request, randomly choose another nest to make the to. This represents the destination of the request i.e. who you are sending the chat message too or who is hosting the website</li>
              <li>Make ants (todo)</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
  </ol>

  <!--   solve them. The biggest problem listed I believe is the fact that it is -->
  <!--   unpredictable and inconsistent. Some pages and files will load very quickly -->
  <!--   because they are very popular, however less visited sites will take a long -->
  <!--   time to load as the ants will have to work much harder to find them. I can -->
  <!--   foresee this leading people on the network to avoid less popular sites -->
  <!--   because they know it will be slow, and stick to the popular sites that load -->
  <!--   fast making it even harder for newcomers to grow their user base and compete -->
  <!--   with top sites. -->
