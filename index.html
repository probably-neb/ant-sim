involving aspects of bio mimetic design</h3>
<p>The internet is an incredibly large network of smaller computer
networks. For the most part, these networks are “client-server”
networks, described by Harris Andrea as “a centralized network in which
[a] server hosts, provides, and maintains the majority of the client’s
data and services”. Another kind of network is called a “peer-to-peer”
network. In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network computers (called peers in this
context) both send and receive data. P2P networks are often used for
file sharing, where each peer will be receiving the files it wants from
other peers on the network and sharing the files it has already.
Although many aspects of networks in general involve aspects of bio
mimetic design, I will focus on peer-to-peer networking in this
piece.</p>

A biological system with properties that can benefit peer-to-peer
networking</h3>
<p>A large problem with P2P networking is figuring out where to get the
data you want from within the network. There are many ways of searching
for the desired data including many “deterministic” approaches as
described by S. Apel and E. Buchmann however they claim these approaches
“leave aside that: peers want to obtain queries at different rates, some
keys are more popular than others, and peers can be less reliable”
(section 4). To solve this problem Apel and Buchmann as well as others
took inspiration from anthills. Ants have to deal with similar problems
when searching for food. The food could be anywhere and some food
sources are better than others. To solve this problem ants leave
pheromones in their path. Future ants can then simply follow the
smelliest path to go where the most of their fellow ants have gone. This
allows them to quickly organize and accomplish complicated tasks
collaboratively without requiring a queen to control them all.</p>

how properties of anthills can actually be implemented in a peer-to-peer
network</h3>
<p>The ants pheromone system can be implemented in a P2P network in
various albeit similar ways, however I will go over the approach taken
by A. Montresor and O. Babaoglu in the aptly named Anthill framework. In
this framework each peer is thought of as an Anthill with various ants
representing the tasks the anthill is capable of such as retrieving a
file. When these ants are called upon to carry out actions, they leave
information related to their current task at each anthill they visit.
This data left behind is the pheromones that can guide future ants
trying to accomplish the same task. Through this system efficient
pathways to popular sites, files, etc are formed so they are easier and
take less time to find.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-of-anthill-inspired-peer-to-peer-networks">4:
limitations of anthill inspired peer-to-peer networks</h3>
<p>As described by S. Apel and E. Buchmann “some drawbacks arise:
Organic systems cannot be fully controlled, their behavior is not really
predictable, and their adaptation and evolution cannot be completely
formally specified, verified, and validated (in a usable and practicable
way)” (section 3.3) Since these problems are inherent to the mimicry of
biological systems, there isn’t a new technology or advancement that
could solve them. The biggest problem listed I believe is the fact that
it is unpredictable and inconsistent. Some pages and files will load
very quickly because they are very popular, however less visited sites
will take a long time to load as the ants will have to work much harder
to find them. I can foresee this leading people on the network to avoid
less popular sites because they know it will be slow, and stick to the
popular sites that load fast making it even harder for newcomers to grow
their user base and compete with top sites.</p>
